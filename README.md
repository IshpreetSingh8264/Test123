Three.js and ARIA Tags
Three.js: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics.
ARIA Tags: Improve accessibility by providing additional information to screen readers.
Web Scraping
Web scraping involves extracting data from websites and storing it for further analysis. This project does not include practical examples due to legal and ethical considerations.

Event Bubbling and Stop Propagation
Event Bubbling: When an event triggers on the target element and bubbles up to its ancestors.
Stop Propagation: Prevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing and bubbling phases.
Session Cookies and Databases
Session Cookies: Store user session data on the client-side.
Databases: Store persistent data, such as user information, on the server-side.
Error Handling
Try-Catch: Handle exceptions and errors in the code.
Finally: Executes code after try and catch, regardless of the outcome.
Promises
Promises: Represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
States: Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected.
Working with Arrays
Array Methods: sort(), reverse(), pop(), push(), shift(), unshift(), splice(), concat(), slice(), join().
Example: Creating arrays and manipulating data.
DOM Manipulation
DOM: The Document Object Model allows JavaScript to interact with HTML elements.
Methods: createElement(), appendChild(), removeChild(), replaceChild().
Node Types: Element, Attribute, Text, Comment.
Git Basics
Main Areas: Working Directory, Staging Area, Local Repository.
Commands: git init, git add, git commit.
String Manipulation
Methods: charCodeAt(), length, replace(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), concat(), indexOf(), search(), slice(), substring(), substr().
Example: Working with string functions.
Arrow Functions and Hoisting
Arrow Functions: A concise way to write function expressions. They do not have their own this.
Hoisting: JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the containing scope.
Local Storage
Local Storage: Web storage that allows JavaScript sites and apps to store and access data right in the browser with no expiration time.
Example: Storing and retrieving user data.
Groups Example
Demonstrates object structures and how to iterate over nested objects.

Hex Color Generator
Function: Generates random hex color values.
Error Handling: Example of using try-catch to handle errors.
